# Project: HTML & CSS Static Page

This is a simple **HTML & CSS** static webpage that I built while following one of Jonas Schmedtmann's courses. The entire page was created from scratch based on the project taught in the course.

## 🚀 Current Status
- The page is still a **work in progress**.
- **Not responsive yet**, but I plan to improve it soon.
- The original design and idea belong to **Jonas Schmedtmann**, and I have included the copyright notice at the bottom of the page.

## 📌 Features
✅ Built with pure **HTML & CSS**  
✅ Follows the structure and styles taught in the course  
✅ Will be improved and optimized over time
